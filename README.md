University of Waterloo Undegraduate Calendar for Math students.

A data scraping project by Ajai Chandi and Daniel Yang.

TODO:
- [X] Make JS script to make the CSVs usable
- [X] Redo the scraping for minors
- [X] Maybe use AWS database backend instead of CSVs (Post and fetch done, deleted AWS RDS instance because im unemployed)
- [ ] Customizable schedule to export (Notion API? Sheets?)
- [ ] Pop-up with description of course and pre-reqs
- [ ] Drag-and-drop customaizable schedule

  
Nice to have features:
- AI chatbot?
- Recommendation features
- Log in + Accounts
- Grade Tracking
