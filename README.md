University of Waterloo Undegraduate Calendar for Math students.

A data scraping project by Ajai Chandi and Daniel Yang.

FRONT END - TODO:
- [ ] Finish export function for schedule [schedule.js]
- [ ] Improve overall UI to look more professional
- [ ] Fix issues with "matching" some of the X00 courses with non-X00 courses
- [X] The x00 courses only have the Course Code not Course Name (STAT440 only). Try to add the name too
- [ ] Fix the colour-themes to make it look nicer
- [X] Add dark-light theme to all pages
- [ ] When courses.html is refreshed with majors selected, it resets as if no majors were selected (Thanks Fahmi)

BACK END - TODO:
- [ ] Fix the Minor Courses formatting (missing the [] around the courses for non-math minors in the big CSV)

Nice to have features:
- AI chatbot?
- Recommendation features
- Log in + Accounts
- Grade Tracking
