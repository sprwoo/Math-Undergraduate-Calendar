University of Waterloo Undegraduate Calendar for Math students.

A data scraping project by Ajai Chandi and Daniel Yang.

FRONT END - TODO:
- [ ] Finish export function for schedule [schedule.js]
- [ ] Improve overall UI to look more professional
- [ ] Fix issues with "matching" some of the X00 courses with non-X00 courses
- [ ] The x00 courses only have the Course Code not Course Name (STAT440 only). Try to add the name too
- [ ] Fix the colour-themes to make it look nicer
- [ ] Add dark-light theme to all pages

BACK END - TODO:
- [X] Make JS script to make the CSVs usable
- [X] Redo the scraping for minors
- [X] Maybe use AWS database backend instead of CSVs (Post and fetch done, deleted AWS RDS instance because im unemployed)
- [X] Be able to list courses for "One of CS 300-400" etc
- [X] Implement binary search for course-searching?
- [ ] Fix the Minor Courses formatting (missing the [] around the courses for non-math minors in the big CSV)

Nice to have features:
- AI chatbot?
- Recommendation features
- Log in + Accounts
- Grade Tracking
