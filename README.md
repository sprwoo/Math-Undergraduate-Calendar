University of Waterloo Undegraduate Calendar for Math students.

A data scraping project by Ajai Chandi and Daniel Yang.

FRONT END - TODO:
- [ ] Improve overall UI to look more professional
- [ ] Fix issues with "matching" some of the X00 courses with non-X00 courses
- [ ] select.html does not reflect what is selected in localStorage

BACK END - TODO:
- [ ] Fix the Minor Courses formatting (missing the [] around the courses for non-math minors in the big CSV)

Nice to have features:
- AI chatbot?
- Recommendation features
- Log in + Accounts
- Grade Tracking
