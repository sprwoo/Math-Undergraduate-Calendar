TO-DOs
- [ ] When in dark mode and accessing select.html, the theme slider resets to light mode. This only happens on this page for some reason
- [ ] Fix the Non-Math Minor Courses formatting 
- [ ] Deployed website keeps past courses highlighted
- [ ] Schedule is NOT mobile friendly 
^^^ (Drag/drop works for mobile in the form of pickup/drop, now for the table to be visible)

Nice to have features:
