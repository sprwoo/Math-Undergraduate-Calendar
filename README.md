University of Waterloo Undegraduate Calendar for Math students.

A data scraping project by Ajai Chandi and Daniel Yang.

FRONT END - TODO:
- [X] FIX DESCRIPTION BUG (when the "addCourseDetailsPopup" function is uncommented, some majors can't select multiple courses and idk why) [courses.js]
- [ ] Finish export function for schedule [schedule.js]
- [X] Fix up duplication bugs with schedule [schedule.js]
- [ ] Add back buttons to all pages
- [X] Add a toggle for "joint majors" in the Select Page [select.js]
- [ ] Make the schedule look more sleek, unique and better [schedule.css]
- [ ] Improve overall UI to look more professional
- [X] Dark/Light Toggle
- [ ] Add loading symbols on all pages
- [X] Make it so that a course can only appear once in the top bar of schedule [schedule.js]
- [X] Fix Staistics & Mathematical Teaching
- [X] Custom Minor
- [X] Custom Minor Fixes
- [ ] Fix issues with "matching" some of the X00 courses with non-X00 courses
- [X] Fix issues with some courses not appearing in schedule (blank box)
- [ ] Fix slowness (I believe this has to do with the X00 courses)
- [X] The "custom minor" doesn't work if I put like COMPUTING or computing. Make the search non-case sensitive
- [X] Make the custom minor automatically have "Minor" so if you input "Computing" = "Computing Minor"

BACK END - TODO:
- [X] Make JS script to make the CSVs usable
- [X] Redo the scraping for minors
- [X] Maybe use AWS database backend instead of CSVs (Post and fetch done, deleted AWS RDS instance because im unemployed)
- [X] Be able to list courses for "One of CS 300-400" etc
- [X] Implement binary search for course-searching?
