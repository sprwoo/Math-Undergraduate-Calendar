University of Waterloo Undegraduate Calendar for Math students.

A data scraping project by Ajai Chandi and Daniel Yang.

TODO:
- Make JS script to make the CSVs usable
- Redo the scraping for minors
- Maybe use AWS database backend instead of CSVs
- Customizable schedule to export (Notion API? Sheets?)
- Pop-up with description of course and pre-reqs
- Drag-and-drop customaizable schedule

  
Nice to have features:
- AI chatbot?
- Recommendation features
- Log in + Accounts
- Grade Tracking
